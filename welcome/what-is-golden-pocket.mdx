Golden Pocket is a trading journal built for perpetual futures traders.

Its purpose is simple: to help traders understand how they actually perform over time.

Golden Pocket automatically collects and structures trading data and transforms it into clear, reliable analytics. It does not provide trade signals or execute trades. Instead, it focuses on measurement and review — the foundation of long-term trading success.

Golden Pocket currently supports Jupiter Perpetuals and Backpack Exchange, with the broader goal of supporting all major perpetual trading venues across decentralized markets.
