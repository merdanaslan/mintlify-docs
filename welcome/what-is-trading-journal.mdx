A trading journal is a structured record of trading activity combined with performance analytics.

At its core, a trading journal answers a fundamental question:
**Is what I am doing actually working?**

Professional traders do not rely on memory, intuition, or isolated wins. They rely on data. A journal allows traders to objectively review outcomes, understand risk exposure, and identify patterns that are invisible when looking at individual trades.

In traditional finance and on centralized exchanges, performance analytics and reporting tools are standard. Traders can review detailed statistics, historical performance, and risk metrics using dedicated analytics and reporting systems built around their trading activity.

Perpetual DEX traders, however, lack this layer.

Golden Pocket exists to close that gap by bringing professional-grade journaling and analytics to perpetual DEX trading environments where this infrastructure has been missing.
