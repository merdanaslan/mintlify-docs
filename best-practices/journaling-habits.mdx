Golden Pocket works best when used consistently and intentionally.

## Journaling Habits That Compound

### Best Practices
- Review your trades daily or weekly, not only after big wins or losses
- Add notes shortly after trades close, while context and emotions are still fresh
- Annotate both winning and losing trades — not just mistakes
- Focus on process quality, not individual outcomes

<Warning>
**Why It Matters:** Trading improvement comes from recognizing recurring patterns in decision-making. Sporadic journaling creates blind spots and reinforces bias.
</Warning>

## Interpreting Performance Metrics Correctly

Raw numbers without context can be misleading.

### Key Principles
- A high win rate does not automatically mean profitability if large losses compensate for many small gains
- Fees and drawdowns matter as much as headline PnL

### How to Use Golden Pocket
- Compare Average Win vs. Average Loss alongside win rate
- Track drawdown depth and recovery time, not just max drawdown
- Monitor fee growth relative to PnL, especially for high-frequency trading

<Tip>
**Common Mistake:** Optimizing for win rate while ignoring payoff ratio and costs
</Tip>

## Using Filters for Focused Analysis

Unfiltered data often hides meaningful insights.

### Best Practices
- Analyze performance by symbol, not only portfolio-wide
- Review specific date ranges to isolate market regimes
- Compare performance before and after strategy changes

**Example:** Filter to one asset and one month to understand why performance shifted, or compare long-only vs. short-only periods during different market conditions.

## Understanding Risk Through Drawdowns

Drawdowns reveal more about a trader than profits.

### How to Use Drawdown Data
- Identify your maximum historical drawdown
- Measure time to recovery after major losses
- Compare drawdown severity across different strategies

<Note>
**Best Practice:** Optimize for acceptable drawdowns, not maximum returns. If drawdowns feel emotionally unmanageable, position sizing is likely too large.
</Note>

## Final Thought

Golden Pocket does not tell you what to trade. It helps you understand how you trade.

Traders who improve over time are not those with the best ideas — they are the ones who measure, review, and adapt consistently.
